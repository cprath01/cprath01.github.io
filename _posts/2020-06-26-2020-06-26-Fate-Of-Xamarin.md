summary: Xamarin is going to be replaced by Maui
---

I read some of the highlights from the [Microsoft Build Keynote](https://mybuild.microsoft.com/sessions/871ef73f-f04a-405b-a0fa-01d7433067d1?source=sessions) at [Syncfusion Blog](https://www.syncfusion.com/blogs/post/goodbye-xamarin-forms-hello-maui.aspx). 

I think this is ultimately a good thing for the future of UI development in .Net but I wonder what argument would be compelling for new developers to pick up Xamarin for the first time over next year knowing the .Net Team is transitioning to .Net Maui.
